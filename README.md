# BookSpider
Specify a novel to crawl related chapter cases

This is my first crawler code based on the scrapy framework.</br>
The main function of the implementation is to crawl the novel specified by the specified novel website.

For some reason,it was not written down at the time, so during the crawling process, some anti-reptile settings were not processed.
